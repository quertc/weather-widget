# Weather widget

The project uses a simple gulp build as well as sass.

Clone the repository and run the application:
```shell
npm i
npm start
```

_To make the widget work, you need:_
  1. In the app/js/index.js on the first line assign a special [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) key to the "APIKey" variable
  2. After all these steps, you can run the application on localhost:3000
