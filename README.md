# Weather widget

The project uses a simple gulp build, which compiles the sass into css. There is no live server.

* To make the widget work, you need:
  * In the app/js/index.js on line 14 replace [key] with your special [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev) key
  * Run the index.html in the browser or create a live server!
